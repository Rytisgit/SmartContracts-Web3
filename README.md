# SmartContracts-Web3

## Usage Case

This Smart Contract is intended for use by companies that offer more comprehensive and accountable sources for the prodcts they sell. In the contract, after some initial negotiations a delivery date, ammount of locations in between, price and discount is offered by the seller which if missed reduced price by a discount that is also decided. If the package is late the buyer can opt out of the whole package and get a refund instead.

## The Flow

1. Shipment requirements are offered by the shipping company

2. The buyer agrees and deposits the money

3. The package receives continous updates on location

4. The package is marked as delivered (if it met the time and location freeuncy requirements the seller gets full price, otherwise he provides a discount by returning some money)

After. If the package is late the buyer is allowed to take out all the deposited money.
